TowerOfPower
============

Tower Of Power - kinda like Pokémon, kinda not like Pokémon

# Game Rules

The player starts in his home, and has to move from here around the map using either the arrow keys, the wasd keys or touch if on iPhone. All throughout the map, buildings and objects block the players movement as one would expect it to do. The player starts with full HP. If he loses all of his HP, it’s game over, and you start from the beginning.
There are certain areas that are blocked off, requiring either an NPC to be defeated before you can proceed, or, that you have a minimum of x reputation.
